              Gibraltar is the only British international financial centre on
              the European mainland. Gibraltar has an English common law
              framework, a highly educated workforce, and UK-trained
              professionals. GibraItar is renowned as one of the best-regulated
              finance centres in the world and has provided cross-border
              financial services for over 30 years. It is the only location that
              offers a favourable fiscal environment for companies and
              individuals. Gibraltar is a self-governing, individual and
              distinct jurisdiction working to Central European time zone. Some
              key facts and tax benefits are: – no value added tax – no wealth
              tax – no capital gains tax – no inheritance tax – no stamp duty on
              transfer of shares – no exchange controls – entered and exited the
              EU together with the United Kingdom – high-quality infrastructure
              – welcomed clampdown by FATF (Financial Action Task force) on
              money laundering – regulatory standards matching those of the UK
              but with the flexible characteristics of a small jurisdiction In
              1997 the Government of Gibraltar established a Finance Centre
              office in order to provide a further boost to financial services,
              an important sector of the Gibraltar economy. The Finance Centre
              collaborates with public sector bodies, regulator and
              business/industry associations, is responsible for the marketing
              and promotion of financial services, offers new businesses a
              comprehensive and informative service centre and provides input
              into strategic planning including the various international
              initiatives and product development. A Deposit Guarantee Scheme
              came into effect in 1999 (http://www.gdgb.gi/explanto.htm). During
              Gibraltar’s membership of the European Union, Gibraltar
              implemented all relevant EU directives. Concurrently with the exit
              from the EU, Gibraltar has implemented the Financial Services Act
              2019 and the Financial Services (Investment Services) Regulations
              2020. The Financial Services Commission (http://www.fsc.gi/) was
              established in 1989 as an independent statutory body, provides
              strong investor protection in relation to banking, insurance, fund
              management, financial services and matches UK standards in
              financial regulation and supervision.
