### 5. Transfer of data abroad or to other entities

Under circumstances, your personal data may be transferred abroad and also outside of the EU or EEA. This is likely for compliance with regulatory authorities outside of the EU/EEA, such as U.S. or Canadian regulators, where we do business in the respective countries and we or our agents in those jurisdictions outside of the EU/EEA may be legally required to disclose personal data of our employees transacting on our behalf in these jurisdictions.

This may include, to quote one of the most important examples, data on the beneficial ownership of client entities, at least insofar as to ascertain whether they are U.S. Persons from the perspective of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.

Our agents in other countries, in or outside of the EU/EEA may equally record telephone conversations or chat logs with our employees for the same purposes that our Company does.
