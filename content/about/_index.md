## This Is Our Story.

Quay Financials (Gibraltar) Limited was formerly Van der Moolen (Gibraltar) Limited (which was part of the Van der Moolen Group whose ultimate parent company was Van der Moolen Holdings NV, a company quoted on Euronext (Amsterdam)). The Gibraltar subsidiary was the subject of a Management Buy-Out in June 2008. Quay Financials (Gibraltar) Limited is now wholly owned by a Gibraltarian holding company.
